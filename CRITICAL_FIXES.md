## **Issue 2: Missing Password Setup Email**

### **Problem:**
- User completed checkout but didn't receive password setup email
- Can't access the product after payment

### **Root Cause:**
The email system has multiple issues:
1. **Email templates not properly configured**
2. **Resend API key may not be set**
3. **Webhook email function may be failing**

### **Immediate Fixes:**

#### **Fix 1: Check Email Configuration**
```bash
# Check if Resend API key is set
supabase secrets list | grep RESEND
```

#### **Fix 2: Test Email Function**
```bash
# Test the founding member email function
curl -X POST https://jydldvvsxwosyzwttmui.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-founding-member-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "sessionId": "test_session"
  }'
```

#### **Fix 3: Manual Email Send**
For the current user who didn't receive email:
1. Go to admin dashboard
2. Find the user in the founding members list
3. Use "Resend Welcome Email" function

---

## **Issue 3: Admin Dashboard Not Working**

### **Problem:**
- Users management shows "coming soon"
- Can't resend password emails or manage users

### **Root Cause:**
The admin dashboard is using placeholder components instead of the actual user management interface.

### **Immediate Fix:**

#### **Fix 1: Enable Full Admin Dashboard**
The actual admin functionality exists but is not being used. Need to:
1. Update routing to use the real admin components
2. Ensure admin authentication is working
3. Connect to the proper user management interface

#### **Fix 2: Quick Admin Access**
For immediate user management:
1. Go to `/dashboard/admin/users` (should show real interface)
2. If that doesn't work, use the main admin dashboard at `/admin`

## **Issue 4: Environment Variables**

### **Problem:**
Vercel deployment may be failing due to missing environment variables.

### **Solution:**
Add these to Vercel dashboard:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://jydldvvsxwosyzwttmui.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=team@uselinky.app
```
