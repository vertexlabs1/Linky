# ðŸš¨ Executive Summary â€“ Restoration Audit (Initial Draft)
 
## Background
Production database was accidentally wiped via `supabase db reset --linked`. Only partial schema is currently restored.
 
## Phase-1 Progress
- Frontend directory enumerated (`src/`).
- Identified critical missing objects (see 01_FRONTEND_SCHEMA_REQUIREMENTS.md).
 
## Immediate Priorities
1. Re-create `public.users` table.
2. Add missing columns to `auth.users`.
